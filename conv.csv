We're very sorry but this is the best option we have for you right now, and the pricing depends on your state, location, and driving data. This is a system applied to all insurance companies around the country.

We're sorry that your rate is not what you expected but even with a high score, additional factors are reviewed when determining the final rate. At this time, the rate would be the best we can offer and can not be negotiated, so we understand you have to do what's best for you.

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about your renewal rate change. We’re happy to explain.

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Changes around you are the “uncontrollable” factors related to renewal rate and include things like:

We've encountered an error with your quote. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your VIN. This may be due to several reasons, but the most likely cause is an error during account set up.

1\. Open app and enable all 3 permissions.
2\. Swipe the screens and tap Continue to quote.
3\. Let it time out and then tap Review profile.

If you see any mistakes, please edit them directly in the app. If there are no inaccuracies, send us a picture of your VIN—normally located on the vehicle itself— and we will be happy to take care of the matter on our end!

The vehicle associated with the attached estimate was totaled by Root in 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia, where the accident happened. Someone is currently riding around with the Texas license plates that were on this Mazda3 at the time of the accident,  HXT7822. I have also attached a screenshot of what the state needs to disassociate our client with the vehicle. Please email me copies of said documents.

Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Thanks for reaching out to see if you may reinstate your policy. I'm happy to help. 

I do apologize for the inconvenience and understand this may be frustrating. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 05/02/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for reaching out. We consider driving behavior as the primary factor when deciding on a final rate. To do that, we use data collected through the app while you drive.

Having reviewed your driving data, we have determined that we’re unable to offer you further coverage. But that means you might be able to get a better rate with another insurer.

We appreciate that you tried Root. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
​

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about canceling your policy. I can further assist. 

We’re sorry to hear you might be leaving Root. If you decide to cancel your policy, you are responsible for doing so yourself.

You will have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

If you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure you cancel in the app on that specific day.

Thank you for reaching out! We can gladly tell you how to swap your vehicles.

A Root policy always has to have at least one vehicle insured. When you are ready to change the vehicles on your policy, you will need to add the new vehicle to the policy first, then remove the old vehicle. 

Here are the steps:
1\. Go to Auto Policy, and then select Profile Information
2\. Select New Vehicle \- enter the 17\-digit VIN and hit Continue.
3\. Tap on the vehicle you want to remove from the policy.
4\. Remove the vehicle by tapping the trash can in the upper right\-hand corner.

Once you have deleted the vehicle\(s\), you will return to the profile screen. Continue forward to review coverages and see your new rate.

Changes are not saved until you complete the checkout process.

That said, you may be required to reinstate your policy as it was canceled on March 28, 2023 as requested. If your policy is canceled, there may be a lapse in coverage. 

The reinstatement would be effective the following day at 12",2,,18,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T04:29:20.836Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,146.0,20012502.0,20012502.0,20012502.0,20012502.0,50672502.0,50672502.0,,,2023-03-31T18:01:26.428Z

Thank you for reaching out and congratulations on your move.

California’s insurance laws mean we cannot offer rates based on telematics \(the technology in our app that measures driving safety\). In order to receive a quote for insurance in California, we’ll need you to give our agents a call.

Our team can be reached at 833\-581\-1456 from 9:00 am\-5:30 pm ET.

Thanks for reaching out. I attempted to file the FR\-19 with the Maryland MVA today, but was unable to do so. The MVA is seeking to verify coverage on 3/8/2023. However. your policy was not active on this date. Your policy was canceled on 3/8/2023 and reinstated effective 3/15/2023. 

You will want to contact the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, Insurance Compliance Division at 410\-768\-7431 to see if there are any requirements they need you to fulfill.

While we cannot file the FR\-19, the active coverage dates have been submitted to Maryland.

Please reach out if you have any other questions.

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about your renewal rate change. We’re happy to explain.

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Changes around you are the “uncontrollable” factors related to renewal rate and include things like:

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Changes around you are the “uncontrollable” factors related to renewal rate and include things like:
Weather emergencies such as hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and so on
Changes in the frequency of accidents in your policy zip code

Thank you for reaching out. Happy to assist you with your quote inquiry. 

The rate you received is for the coverage you’ll need to complete our test drive. Since we don’t have driving data for you yet, we don’t know how safe you are behind the wheel. This rate is temporary.

It’s possible that once you complete the test drive, your new quote will be lower. Of course, we can’t promise that, but we’d love it if you stuck with our test drive. It’s the only way to get a rate based primarily on how you drive.

If you choose not to have full coverage \(comprehensive and collision coverage\) is up to you, you can go ahead and not add them right now to your policy. 

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Best regards, and please take care.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you with the quote you want. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 05/16/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

We’re so happy to see you driving with Root.

Our referral program is pretty straightforward. To qualify for a bonus, your referral must use the link sent directly from your app to download the Root app and create a profile. This is how we keep record of referrals. After you and your friend have both successfully finished the test drive and you both qualify for a quote, we'll send you a link that will allow you to choose how you’d like
to receive your referral bonus, including a bank transfer.

It doesn’t appear the referral link was used to join your accounts. Unfortunately, this means we won’t be able to honor the referral bonus. We’re sorry for any disappointment. Moving forward, when you make referrals to friends and family, be sure to tell them to use the link you send to download the app.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

My name is Linda and I’m a Google certified web professional. We are
working closely with many companies and industries to create a new website

what would be the cost and how well that can be built. Then I surely can
help. We design websites at a very affordable price and make them suitable
for all business classes.

industries. From mining, hospitals, doctors, restaurants, resorts,
insurance companies, tour operators, travel agencies, eCommerce companies,
jewellers and many more.

but also ensure search engine friendly. Following are some more add-on
technical factors which we mandate in the work process. Search Engine *Friendly

Thanks for reaching out to see if you may get a quote. I'm happy to help. 

I do apologize for the inconvenience and understand this may be frustrating. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 07/11/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about your renewal rate change. We’re happy to explain.

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be my pleasure to assist you regarding your renters address change request.

To update your address, you’ll need to cancel your current renters policy and then buy a new policy with the correct address. Within the app, just tap Renters Policy and then Cancel my renters policy.

You’ll need to wait 24 hours before you can buy a new renters policy with us. You’ll see a renters quote button appear in the app when you’re eligible for a new policy.

Don’t forget, you’ll need to update your address for your auto policy, too.

If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to reach out. Always happy to help.
​

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the reinstatement of your policy. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 05/03/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Have a wonderful day!",2,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T03:14:23.242Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,134.0,2541720.0,2541720.0,2541720.0,2541720.0,37678478.0,37678478.0,,,2023-03-28T13:43:25.358Z

We’re sorry to hear you might be leaving Root but we understand you have to do what's best for you. Since you are the only one allowed to make those changes, we're happy to provide you with the steps. If you decide to cancel your policy, you are responsible for doing so yourself.

You will have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

If you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure you cancel in the app on that specific day.

Thanks for reaching out. 

Your last day to make a payment before your policy is canceled is 03/28/2023.

Looking over your account, we're not able to extend the date any further than 03/29/2023 at 12:01 am. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. However, after the policy is canceled, the app will let you know if you will be able to reinstate the policy. 

Please note: reinstatement will include a lapse in coverage between the date of cancellation and the reinstatement effective date. The reinstatement effective date will be the day following the reinstatement, at 12:01 AM.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the payment extension you need.

After reviewing your account, your policy was canceled on 03/28/2023. You will need to use the app to determine whether or not you can still reinstate your policy.

Please note: reinstatement will include a lapse in coverage between the date of cancellation and the reinstatement effective date. The reinstatement effective date will be the day following the reinstatement, at 12:01AM.

Here’s how to reinstate in the app:
Open the app.
Underneath the inactive insurance card, you’ll see Tap here to reinstate your policy.
Answer a few questions to determine eligibility
Purchase your policy.​
​
​Please keep in mind, if you choose to pay your premium monthly, your due date has not changed.

If you do not see an option to reinstate, the window to do so has passed. You are not insured with Root and you will need to find another carrier. Let us know if you have any questions.

Have a wonderful day!",2,,14,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T02:36:11.685Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,135.0,18163674.0,18163674.0,18163674.0,18163674.0,55591989.0,55591989.0,,,2023-03-28T18:03:47.380Z

Thank you so much for reaching out to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be a pleasure to help you out regarding your cancelation request. We’re sorry to hear you might be leaving Root. However, we understand you need to seek out what is best for you and those around you. We absolutely respect that. If you decide to cancel your policy, you can do it in just a few easy steps.

Once you tap on Auto Policy, go to the bottom of the options where it says Cancel my policy in orange letters.

You will then have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

Now, if you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure to cancel in the app on that specific day.

And talking about a refund, typically you are refunded b",2,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T02:33:13.009Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,139.0,17993761.0,17993761.0,17993761.0,17993761.0,55600752.0,55600752.0,,,2023-03-28T17:59:53.781Z

Thanks for reaching out.

To see how a new vehicle will affect your premium, you'll need the VIN of your new car.
If you haven't yet purchased the vehicle and don't have a VIN, you can get the VIN of a
very similar year, make, and model. Most dealers have the VINs of new and used inventory
on their websites.

Here’s how to add a vehicle in the app:
Tap Auto Policy.
Select Profile information.
Choose Add vehicle.
Enter the VIN and tap Continue for the updated price​​
​
​
​Here’s how to remove a vehicle in the app:
Tap Auto Policy.
Select Profile information.
Choose the vehicle to remove.
Tap the trash can icon and Continue to see your updated price.
​
​

If you're not ready to add/remove the new vehicle at this time, simply close out of the app without confirming any changes.

Let us know if you need anything else. Always happy to help.

We've encountered an error with your quote. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your VIN. This may be due to several reasons, but the most likely cause is an error during account set up.

Please review your VIN in the app. The one we have on file as of now is: 1HGCY1F20PA009243.

1\. Open app and enable all 3 permissions.
2\. Swipe the screens and tap Continue to quote.
3\. Let it time out and then tap Review profile.

If you see any mistakes, please edit them directly in the app. If there are no inaccuracies, send us a picture of your VIN—normally located on the vehicle itself— and we will be happy to take care of the matter on our end!

We apologize for any delays, and please feel free to reply to this email with any questions or updates on the matter.

While I am sad to hear you will be leaving Root, it will be my pleasure to guide you through the cancellation process.

If you decide to cancel your policy, you are responsible for doing so yourself.

You will have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

If you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure you cancel in the app on that specific day.

Please be advised you may or may not receive a refund of your unused premium. Typically, you are refunded based on the remaining time of your policy. If you change your mind, you may only have a few weeks to reinstate your policy.

We hope you’ll stay a member of our safe driving community. Let us know if you have any questions we can answer to keep you as",2,,12,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T02:10:57.856Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,160.0,17615714.0,17615714.0,17615714.0,17615714.0,56557858.0,56557858.0,,,2023-03-28T17:54:37.875Z

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you with the steps to see how a new vehicle will affect your premium, you'll need the VIN of your new car.

Here’s how to add a vehicle in the app:
Tap Auto Policy.
Select Profile information.
Choose Add vehicle.
Enter the VIN and tap Continue for the updated price​​
​
​
​Here’s how to remove a vehicle in the app:
Tap Auto Policy.
Select Profile information.
Choose the vehicle to remove.
Tap the trash can icon and Continue to see your updated price.
​
​If you're not ready to add/remove the new vehicle at this time, simply close out of the app without confirming any changes.

Thanks for reaching out. Happy to assist you with how you can link someone to your account. 

You can send a link to any driver who will be covered under your plan. This will allow your other drivers to download the app and log into your shared account.

Please note, prior to creating an account the invited driver must not have the app downloaded. If the app is already downloaded, the driver must delete the app and follow the steps below.

To invite a driver to an active policy:
Tap menu and select Drivers.
Under the driver you want to invite, select Text Invite..
You will be prompted to send a text message to the new driver.
Following the texted link, the new driver will create a new account using their own email address.
Once created, they will then be provided a link to use to download the app.

Next, the new driver will Sign in and when prompted, will select their own name to connect their account.
​From here, they will be added to your account and have the same access to edit, view, and file",2,,13,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T02:02:50.610Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,125.0,17844427.0,17844427.0,17844427.0,17844427.0,57273817.0,57273817.0,,,2023-03-28T17:58:15.305Z

We're very sorry but this is the best option we have for you right now, and the pricing depends on your state, location, and driving data. This is a system applied to all insurance companies around the country.

We're sorry that your rate is not what you expected but even with a high score, additional factors are reviewed when determining the final rate. At this time, the rate would be the best we can offer and can not be negotiated, however, we understand you have to do what's best for you.

Kelsey. 

Thanks for your response. 

I recommend deleting the driver and adding him again; you can also try to change the password. 

You can edit the vehicles, drivers, and address on your quote via the Root app! Once in the app, you can view the plan and go to one of the quotes. You'll see Insured Drivers and Insured Vehicles \(it says ""What's Insured"" on some accounts\). You can tap on and edit that information, including the driver\(s\), vehicle\(s\), or the address on your quote.

Here are the instructions on how you can reset your password:
Open the app.
Click Log in.
Click Email.
Type in the email you used during sign\-up, then click the arrow in the bottom right corner.
Click the Forgot your password? Button, which is located directly below the password box.
Verify your email, then click the arrow in the bottom right corner.
Check your email and follow the instructions on resetting your password.
Navigate back to the app and try to log in with your new password.

Thanks for reaching out to see if you may reinstate your policy. I'm happy to help. 

I do apologize for the inconvenience and understand this may be frustrating. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 02/18/2023. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be my pleasure to assist you regarding your extension inquiry. 

It seems you have a payment overdue.

When the system identifies the payment is overdue, it automatically generates a cancellation notice with a certain deadline on it. 

When this happens, it means we, unfortunately, will not be able to help you on acquiring an extension as it is an automated process. 

However, if a policy surpasses the threshold and gets canceled due to non\-payment, you could still be eligible for reinstatement.

In other words, if your policy is eligible for reinstatement, and you are the Primary Named Insured, then you’ll be able to determine if you’re eligible to reinstate in the app. The option to reinstate must be present, and if any incident that could give rise to a claim occurred during the time the policy was canceled, there could be a lapse of coverage due to the policy not being active.

Thanks for reaching out.

We consider driving behavior as the primary factor when deciding on a quote. To do that, we use data collected during the test drive, including what you saw on your driver scorecard.

Once we consider all of the test drive data, we have determined that we’re unable to offer you a quote. That just means you’d be able to get a better rate with another insurer.

We appreciate that you tried Root, and please let us know if you have any other questions.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the reinstatement of your policy. 

After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 11/07/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks for reaching out. Happy to assist you with how getting a quote works. 

Root is different than other insurance companies. We use an app to give you a quote based on how you drive. Our prices are kept low because we only insure good drivers.

Here’s how it works: after you download the Root app and sign up, you’ll start the test drive. The app measures your driving to calculate your rate. If you’re a good driver, you’ll receive a quote at the end of the test drive. The better you drive, the better your rate. You will not be covered by Root until you complete your test drive and accept your quote.

Drive around like you normally would, the app does the rest \(it runs in the background, so there’s no need to turn it on or off\). Our app also makes managing car insurance easy. Use it to file a claim, find your insurance card, or make changes to your policy.

Thanks for reaching out. Happy to assist you if you can have a new quote. 

After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 07/25/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the new policy you are trying to get. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 06/17/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks for reaching out—great question. Please allow me to guide you on how you can edit this coverage on the app.

No car insurance coverage goes by the name “full coverage,”  but most folks think of full coverage as a policy that combines the following:
• State\-required liability or no\-fault insurance coverage to cover bodily injury and property damages to others in an accident you cause.
• Collision coverage to pay for damages to your vehicle in the event of an accident.
• Comprehensive coverage covers vandalism, theft, storm damage, and other damages that do not result from an accident.

For more info, check out our FAQ page \(joinroot.com/help/\), all coverage options \(joinroot.com/coverage/\), or one of our blogs like Car insurance in everyday English \(joinroot.com/blog/how\-to\-choose…\).

To view your current coverages, open the app and select Auto Policy. Then tap Coverages. If you’d like to make any changes, tap the type of coverage  \(Comprehensive, Medical Payments, etc.\) a",2,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-28T00:54:07.618Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,0.0,185.0,17745710.0,17745710.0,17745710.0,17745710.0,61298092.0,61298092.0,,,2023-03-28T17:56:26.362Z

Thanks for reaching out!

We're happy to assist you with the steps to get coverage if possible. You will need to use the app to determine if you are eligible for a new quote. Here’s how:
Open the app
On the home screen, select the option to View Quote
Update any information as necessary

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be my pleasure to assist you regarding your payment question.

Currently, we only accept credit or debit cards and payments in full through them. This is because Root's billing system is automated, which means your payment will be collected automatically on a monthly or full\-term basis. You'll need to keep one card on file at all times. The app makes it easy to edit payment methods and see upcoming payment dates. We're sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. 

If you still have questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out back. We're always willing and happy to help.

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be my pleasure to assist you regarding your reinstatement. 

It seems your last reinstatement day will be 03/29/2023.

You will need to use the app to determine if you are eligible for a new quote on this day. Here’s how:
On the 29 of this month, open the app
On the home screen, select the option to View Quote
Update any information as necessary

If you are not seeing this option, then it is not available and Root will be unable to provide you coverage at this time. If this should change, we’ll be sure to reach out.

We thank you for your interest in Root. Let us know if you have any questions. Always happy to help.

We've encountered an issue with your Root account and want to help clear it up. We aren’t able to run your Motor Vehicle Report, likely because of an issue with the profile setup. Please reply to this email with the driver's license information, including name, date of birth, gender, full address and state of residence. If you are able to send us a picture of the license, that would be best.

We’re sorry for any delays, and please feel free to reply to this email with any questions or updates.

Thanks for reaching out. Happy to assist you with how it works to get a quote. 

Root is different than other insurance companies. We use an app to give you a quote based on how you drive. Our prices are kept low because we only insure good drivers.

Here’s how it works: after you download the Root app and sign up, you’ll start the test drive. The app measures your driving to calculate your rate. If you’re a good driver, you’ll receive a quote at the end of the test drive. The better you drive, the better your rate. You will not be covered by Root until you complete your test drive and accept your quote.

Drive around like you normally would, the app does the rest \(it runs in the background, so there’s no need to turn it on or off\). Our app also makes managing car insurance easy. Use it to file a claim, find your insurance card, or make changes to your policy.

Still have questions? Check out our FAQ page​.

​See you on the road,

Thanks for reaching out. Happy to assist you with your inquiry about the achievement points. 

Achievements in the Root app are a fun way to improve your driving and show off your skills to friends. They don’t affect your rate directly.

Hope that helps to clarify the Root achievements.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the Test drive. First, you need to turn on permissions, the reason are seeing that you need to start the test drive and also that you need more trips is because the other driver has started with the test driver.

After that go to 'Location'.

Once there, choose 'Always' instead of the other options.

Regarding the app quitting when opening, if the issue persists, we would recommend that you delete and reinstall the app.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the reinstatement of your policy. 

After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 01/13/2023. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you for reaching out.
​

It looks like the receipt you provided for reimbursement is dated 10\-22\-2022. According to the policy contract, we are unable to issue reimbursement as it has been over 60 days since the incident.
​

I’m sorry there isn’t more we can do, but we are required to abide by the terms and conditions laid out in the policy, as it is a legally binding contract.
​

If we can answer any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach back out.

I'm happy to explain the next steps for you to have an active policy. 

Root is different than other insurance companies. We use an app to give you a quote based on how you drive. Our prices are kept low because we only insure good drivers.

Here’s how it works: after you download the Root app and sign up, you’ll start the test drive. The app measures your driving to calculate your rate. If you’re a good driver, you’ll receive a quote at the end of the test drive. The better you drive, the better your rate. You will not be covered by Root until you complete your test drive and accept your quote.

Drive around like you normally would, the app does the rest \(it runs in the background, so there’s no need to turn it on or off\). Our app also makes managing car insurance easy. Use it to file a claim, find your insurance card, or make changes to your policy.

Thanks for reaching out. Sorry you’re having trouble processing your payment.

Here are some troubleshooting tips to try.
Try deleting all other cards on file and reentering the card you want to use.
Check that your card’s expiration date is correct.
Verify you have the funds in your account to make the payment.
Contact your bank to make sure the charge isn’t being flagged as fraud or that overdraft protection isn’t preventing the transaction.
Verify the address for the card matches the address for your Root account.
​

Hopefully, this helps you to successfully make your payment. Let us know if you still have problems or additional questions.

Kind regards, and please take care.

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be my pleasure to assist you regarding your inquiry about adding a vehicle and restarting your policy.

After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 11/03/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

I hope this information helps.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you. Always happy to help.
​

Thanks for reaching out. I attempted to file the FR\-19 with the Maryland MVA today, but was unable to do so. The MVA is seeking to verify coverage on 4/11/2022. However, your Root policy was not active on this date. 

You will want to contact the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, Insurance Compliance Division at 410\-768\-7431 to see if there are any requirements they need you to fulfill.

While we cannot file the FR\-19, the active coverage dates have been submitted to Maryland. If you had coverage with a different insurance provider on the date in question, they may be able to assist you further.

Thanks for reaching out.

We're happy to assist you regarding the quote you want. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to self request on 01/09/2023. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

We hope that you’ll consider re\-joining us, but at this time you must wait a full calendar year from the policy's cancellation date before requesting another quote \(so long as you still qualify\).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Have a wonderful day!",2,,17,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T23:48:46.988Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,148.0,148.0,6078170.0,6078170.0,6078170.0,6078170.0,52831182.0,52831182.0,,,2023-03-28T14:30:21.846Z

We've encountered an issue with your Root account and want to help clear it up. We aren’t able to run your Motor Vehicle Report, likely because of an issue with the profile setup. Please reply to this email with the driver's license information, including name, date of birth, gender, full address and state of residence.

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about your renewal rate change. We’re happy to explain.

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Changes around you are the “uncontrollable” factors related to renewal rate and include things like:
Weather emergencies such as hurricanes, wildfires,",3,,11,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T23:35:28.516Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,,,6992195.0,6992195.0,6992195.0,6992195.0,53763679.0,53763679.0,,,2023-03-28T14:32:36.607Z

While I am sad to hear you will be leaving Root, it will be my pleasure to guide you through the cancellation process.

If you decide to cancel your policy, you are responsible for doing so yourself.

You will have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

If you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure you cancel in the app on that specific day.

Please be advised you may or may not receive a refund of your unused premium. Typically, you are refunded based on the remaining time of your policy. If you change your mind, you may only have a few weeks to reinstate your policy.

We hope you’ll stay a member of our safe driving community. Let us know if you have any questions we can answer to keep you as a",2,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T23:32:33.173Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,120.0,120.0,11580516.0,11580516.0,11580516.0,11580516.0,58347343.0,58347343.0,,,2023-03-28T15:45:51.988Z

Please reply to this email with the driver's license information, including name, date of birth, gender, full address and state of residence. If you are able to send us a picture of the license, that would be best.

We’re sorry for any delays, and please feel free to reply to this email with any questions or updates.

Thank you so much for reaching out to Root! My name is Salvador, and it will be a pleasure to help you out. We’re sorry to hear you might be leaving Root. However, we understand you need to seek out what is best for you and those around you. We absolutely respect that. If you decide to cancel your policy, you can do it in just a few easy steps.

Once you tap on Auto Policy, go to the bottom of the options where it says Cancel my policy in orange letters.

You will then have two options:

• Cancellation effective immediately
• Cancellation at the end of your 6\-month policy term

If you decide to cancel your policy, tap Auto Policy in the app. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Cancel my policy \(written in bright orange\). Then Continue.

Now, if you need to cancel on a specific day that is not the end of your policy term, you will need to make sure to cancel in the app on that specific day.

And talking about a refund, typically you are refunded based on the remaining time of your",2,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T23:24:22.738Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,162.0,162.0,17100867.0,17100867.0,17100867.0,17100867.0,63878129.0,63878129.0,,,2023-03-28T17:09:00.887Z

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root!

It will be our pleasure to assist you regarding your inquiries about the cancellation threshold.

When the system identifies the payment is overdue, it automatically generates a cancellation notice with a certain deadline on it. 

When this happens it means we, unfortunately, will not be able to help you modify it as it is an automated process. 

However, if a policy surpasses the threshold and gets canceled due to non\-payment, you could still be eligible for reinstatement.

In other words, if your policy is eligible for reinstatement, and you are the Primary Named Insured, then you’ll be able to determine if you’re eligible to reinstate in the app. The option to reinstate must be present, and if any incident that could give rise to a claim occurred during the time the policy was canceled, there could be a lapse of coverage due to the policy not being active. 

All coverage\-related questions will be handled by an adjuster based on the merits of ea",3,,13,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T23:15:56.753Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,,,15875702.0,15875702.0,15875702.0,15875702.0,62618949.0,62618949.0,,,2023-03-28T16:39:35.722Z

We’re sorry to hear you’re leaving Root.

We’ll be able to help you cancel your policy once we receive a cancellation request email from the Primary Named Insured on the policy. You may also call customer service for assistance with cancelling immediately.

To request cancellation, reply with the following:
Policyholder’s first and last name
Policy number

Your request cannot be honored until the above information is provided. Any refund due will be issued to your last\-used payment method.

Backdating can be requested once the policy is canceled and Carvana has provided you with the appropriate document.

You must reach out to Carvana directly to request documentation for backdating. Carvana will provide you with a letter stating the vehicle was either returned or the purchase did not go through.

The letter must meet the following requirements:
Primary insured’s first and last name
VIN of the vehicle
Date
Carvana letterhead
PDF format

If you have obtained the letter already, please attach the PDF",3,,19,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,done,,,926391.0,926391.0,926391.0,926391.0,926391.0,926391.0,,,2023-03-27T23:23:23.355Z

Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about what happened to your vehicle. 

We do offer our customers with Comprehensive and Collision coverage free windshield repair. In the unfortunate event that your glass is cracked, simply submit your glass claim in the app under File a Claim.  Our partner Safelite will handle your glass claim, whether you choose to have them make your repairs or you go with another company. If the windshield has to be replaced, it’s the same process. You may have to cover your deductible.

I see that you currently have a $250 Comprehensive deductible. What this means is that in the event you have to file a windshield replacement claim, you would pay $250 out of pocket first and then Root would pay for the remaining cost of the replacement.

To view or change your current coverages, open the app and select Auto Policy. Then tap Coverages. If you'd like to make any changes, just tap the type \(Comprehensive, Medical Payments, etc.\), and make the edits. You’ll see your upd",2,,12,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T22:54:18.895Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,156.0,156.0,18225296.0,18225296.0,18225296.0,18225296.0,65006401.0,65006401.0,,,2023-03-28T16:58:32.647Z

Thanks for reaching out.

I'm glad to assist with reinstating, we apologize for any inconvenience. After taking a closer look, it seems your policy was canceled due to nonpayment on 09/09/2022. Unfortunately, this means the last day for you to reinstate your policy has passed.

Thanks for reaching out to inquire about your renewal rate change. I'm sorry the rate was not what you were expecting. It is my pleasure to explain your renewal rate. 

Every six months, Root re\-evaluates many of the rate\-determining factors that we looked at initially to see if anything has changed over the course of the current policy term that would cause a greater risk during the next policy term.  If the risk has increased in any way, adjustments to your rate may be made so that we can continue to be able to effectively cover anything that might create a loss for you in the future. In order to reassess the risk, we review the 3 types of changes that could affect you as a driver and policyholder: changes on your end, changes around you, and changes on our end.

Changes on your end include various “controllable” factors such as potential changes to driving history such as tickets, claims filed, accidents, and so on.

Changes around you are the “uncontrollable” factors related to renewal rate a",2,,12,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T22:50:58.950Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,274.0,274.0,13312140.0,13312140.0,13312140.0,13312140.0,60053190.0,60053190.0,,,2023-03-28T15:32:55.187Z

Carvana will provide the VIN on the letter required if you wish to get a full refund. You can also find it on the Root app under Auto Policy. 

Otherwise, you can reply with your full name, the Root policy number and the date of cancellation to get a pro\-rated refund based on the unused premium left. Please remember that the cancellation date would need to be a present date. 

Let us know if you need something else—we’re happy to help.

Thank you so much for reaching out back to Root! My name is Salvador, and I will be pleased to assist you regarding your cancellation and refund inquiry.

I was able to review the cancellation of your policy, that is going to be effective 04/28/2023. This means that when this date arrives, your coverage will automatically expire and will not renew. You should also be receiving an automated email shortly, verifying this cancellation.

Please keep in mind that a limited reinstatement window may be offered, if any. If you wish to reinstate your policy, you must do so within the app. If you do not see an option to reinstate in your app, then it is no longer available.

Please note: reinstatement will include a lapse in coverage between the date of cancellation and the reinstatement effective date. The reinstatement effective date will be the day following the reinstatement, at 12:01AM.

If any incident that could give rise to a claim occurred during the time the policy was cancelled, all coverage relate",3,,15,0,,,,,,,,False,2023-03-27T22:45:11.842Z,All Emails,done,1.0,,,,,False,done,,,14924317.0,14924317.0,14924317.0,14924317.0,61712475.0,61712475.0,,,2023-03-28T15:53:44.347Z
